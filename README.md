## Challenge
The Kanini evaluation portal is designed for HR Admins, Employees, and Job seekers. HRs can assign assessments to employees and job seekers. Employees can also request assessments from managers or admins. Employees and job seekers can attempt assessments to improve their grades. Job seekers can take assessments as part of the interview screening process. The portal provides an easy way to create and reuse assessments, and employees can request and attempt assessments.
